## 📝 About me 
🚀 I am 19 years old and currently a university student with a strong interest in technological software development. I possess the ability to quickly assimilate new knowledge and apply it effectively in professional environments. I am actually searching for a job opportunity that will allow me to develop my skills and gain experience in the field.

📓 One interesting aspect about me is that I am the owner of a YouTube channel with 26K subscribers, focusing on movies and TV shows. Managing this channel has taught me valuable lessons in working independently without a boss, and has honed my skills in being autonomous, which has greatly contributed to shaping who I am today.

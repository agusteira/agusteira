## 📝 About me 
🚀 I’m a backend developer with experience in the banking industry, focused on building scalable and efficient software solutions for traditional banking systems. I have completed my university studies in computer science and I’m passionate about technology and backend development. I learn quickly and apply new knowledge effectively in professional environments. I also have experience working with interdisciplinary teams, always aiming to solve problems productively and efficiently.

📓 One interesting aspect about me is that I am the owner of a YouTube channel with 34K subscribers, focusing on movies and TV shows. Managing this channel has taught me valuable lessons in working independently without a boss, and has honed my skills in being autonomous, which has greatly contributed to shaping who I am today.
